\section{Numerical Simulation}
\subsection{Boundary Conditions}
\begin{frame}
    We are mainly interested in situations where the SAW is the primary
    driving force, so we perform simulations with $\beta = 0$. 

    We consider the initial state of our system to be described by an equation 
    $g(x)$. This allows us to define our boundary conditions
    \begin{gather*}
        \func{h}{0,t} = \func{g}{0}, \quad \func{h}{L_x, t} = \func{g}{L_x} \\ 
        \func{h_x}{0, t} = 0 = \func{h_x}{L_x, t}
    \end{gather*}
