    Motivated by the acoustowetting phenomenon and its applications to the dynamic wetting 
    of objects by a coating liquid, we explore the influence of surface acoustic waves and gravity on the motion of a thin film
    flowing over a surface. We consider surfaces that may be both inclined and include topographical features like trenches, mounds, bumps, etc. 
    Using the lubrication approximation, we reduce the equations of motion for the film
    to a single nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the film height relative to the 
    surface topography in time and space.

\section{Introduction}
The motion of thin liquid films with fronts is a relatively
ubiquitous dynamic in nature that also has applications to a number of technical fields and processes. 
Particularly with respect to coating processes, the influence of other factors besides viscous and surface tension
forces (such as gravity \cite{diez2002computing} and electric fields \cite{veremieiev2012electrified}) has also been 
studied. Recent experiments have shown that high frequency surface acoustic waves may be a novel method 
for coating techniques, particularly between two liquids where one of the liquids is not influenced by the acoustic streaming, so in this report we study the affect of these acoustic waves on the dynamics 
of thin liquid films. Specifically, we approach the problem using the lubrication approximation to reduce the 
Navier-Stokes equations into a single nonlinear PDE and simplify the interactions between the two liquids
by considering the stationary one to be a topographical feature of our surface. Both the influence of surface acoustic
waves on the spreading of liquid films (see \cite{altshuler2016free}) and coating over topography with gravity as the primary driving have been previously 
studied (see \cite{kalliadasis2000steady,stillwagon1988topo,veremieiev2011gravity}), but to the best of our knowledge the 
intersection of these two interactions has not been studied.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
The presented results show that a reasonably accurate model can be developed for simulating the movement of thin 
film flows over topography when driven primarily by SAWs. We first develop a governing nonlinear PDE by simplifying the 
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for the problem using the lubrication approximation, with a further simplification 
to reduce our equation to two spatial dimensions instead of three. We then solve the PDE over a domain of interest by discretizing 
into a system of ODEs, which is then solved using an implicit time stepping scheme. However, a limitation of our model is that 
it does not realistically model the interactions between a flowing and stationary liquid as the assumption that the stationary liquid can be 
modelled as a feature of the surface topography does not take into the account of leakiness of SAWs in liquids.
