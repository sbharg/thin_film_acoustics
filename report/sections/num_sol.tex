\subsection{Spatial Discretization}
If we define the domain of interest as $\lrb{0, L_x}$, we can discretize the 
domain into points $x_j = j\Delta x$ for $j = 0, \ldots, N_x$ where 
$\Delta x = L_x / N_x$ and $N_x$ is the number of grid points excluding the origin. 
If we further define $\func{h_j}{t} = \func{h}{x_j, t}$, we can discretize 
\cref{eq:two_dim_final} into a system of ordinary differential equations of the form 
\begin{equation}
    \deriv{h_j}{t} = f_j = \mathrm{Bo}\cos \beta f_j^{(1)} - f_j^{(2)} -  \frac{\mathrm{Bo}}{\varepsilon} \sin \beta f_j^{(3)} +  
    \frac{k_i \lrp{1 + \alpha_1^2} \mathrm{We_{ac}}}{\varepsilon} f_j^{(4)}, \quad j = 0, \ldots, N_x
    \label{eq:ode_sys}
\end{equation}
where $f_j^{(k)}$ is the discretization of the $k$-th term in
the right-hand side of \cref{eq:two_dim_final}. Because the governing equation 
contains high order derivatives, the discretization used for certain components 
needs special attention in order to not lead to a large computational stencil.

\subsubsection{Fourth-Order Term}
Following the method outlined in \cite{kondic2003instabilities}, discretizing the fourth order term (i.e.\! $f_j^{(2)}$) can be done by a combination
of forward and backward differences. If we define 
\begin{align*}
    h_{x, j} = \frac{h_{j+1} - h_j}{\Delta x} \quad \quad \quad h_{\overline{x}, j} = \frac{h_{j} - h_{j-1}}{\Delta x}
\end{align*}
as the forward and backward differences, respectively, then a possible discretization is 
\begin{equation}
    f_j^{\lrp{2}} = \lrp{\func{a}{h_{i-1}, h_i} \phi_{\overline{x}x\overline{x}, j}}_{x, j}
    \label{eq:f2_disc}
\end{equation}
where $\func{a}{j_1, j_2} = \frac{1}{2} \lrp{{j_1}^3 + {j_2}^3}$. This discretization leads to a 
second order approximation that has a five point stencil, which is better than the seven point stencil
that would result from using a central differencing scheme. 

\subsubsection{Lower Order Terms}
